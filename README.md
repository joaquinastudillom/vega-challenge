# Vega challenge (WIP)

## Setup your local environment

### Troubleshooting

## Running locally

### Install

You need `node v20.x.x` and `npm` installed in your system. Please, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to install the proper Node version.

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start local server

Runs the app in development mode:

```bash
npm dev
```

### Run the unit test (missing)

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode:

```bash
npm test
```

Take a look at the available commands under `npm test`
